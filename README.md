|-------------|-------------|
| `puts`      | The `puts` method is used to output/print a string followed by a newline character (`\n`). |
| `gets`      | The `gets` method is used to get input from a user. It reads a line from the input and returns it as a string, including the newline character. |
| `chomp`     | The `chomp` method is used to remove the trailing newline character from a string. Often used with `gets` to remove the newline character when reading user input. |
| `reverse`   | The `reverse` method is used to reverse the characters of a string. |
| `to_i`      | The `to_i` method is used to convert a string or other data types to an integer (if possible). If the conversion is not possible, it returns 0. |
