# Ruby Interpreted Language

| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `puts`      | The `puts` method is used to output/print a string followed by a newline character (`\n`). |
| `print`     | The `print` method prints the given object to the console without adding a newline character. It keeps the cursor on the same line. |
| `gets`      | The `gets` method is used to get input from a user. It reads a line from the input and returns it as a string, including the newline character. |
| `chomp`     | The `chomp` method is used to remove the trailing newline character from a string. Often used with `gets` to remove the newline character when reading user input. |
| `reverse`   | The `reverse` method is used to reverse the characters of a string. |
| `to_i`      | The `to_i` method is used to convert a string or other data types to an integer (if possible). If the conversion is not possible, it returns 0. |
|`begin and rescue`| The `begin and rescue` form a block that allows you to handle exceptions. Code inside the begin block is executed, and if any exception occurs, it is caught by the rescue block.
|`puts data`| Outputs the content of the file to the console. The puts method adds a newline character at the end.
|`rescue StandardError => e`| Catches exceptions of the type StandardError (a common base class for many Ruby exceptions) and assigns the exception object to the variable e
| `end` |     | `end` ends a block of code.|
